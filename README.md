1. Y and X relationship
   
R-Squared (R2) equals 0.3771. This means that 37.7% of the variability of Y is explained by X.
Correlation (R) equals 0.6141. This means that there is a strong direct relationship between X and Y.
The Standard deviation of the residuals (Sres) equals 0.8767.
The slope: b₁=0.08318 CI[0.06369, 0.1027] means that when you increase X by 1, the value of Y increases by 0.08318.
The y-intercept: b₀=-3.0999 CI[-4.699, -1.5008] means that when X equals 0, the prediction of Y's value is -3.0999.
The x-intercept equals 37.2678.

2. Goodness of fit
   
Overall regression: right-tailed, F(1,118) = 71.4358, p-value = 8.749e-14. Since p-value < α (0.05), we reject H0.
The linear regression model, Y = b0+ b1X + ε, provides a better fit than the model without the independent variable resulting in Y = b0 + ε.

The slope (b₁): two-tailed, T(118)=8.452, p-value = 8.749e-14. For one predictor it is the same as the p-value for the overall model.
The y-intercept (b₀): two-tailed, T(118) = -3.8388, p-value = 0.0002003. Hence, b₀ is significantly different from zero.

3. Residual normality
   
The linear regression model assumes normality for residual errors. The Shapiro-Wilk p-value equals 0.0004779. It is assumed that the data is not normally distributed, But since the sample size is large, it should not adversely affect the regression model.

4. Outliers
   
Outliers may affect the regression line.
If the distribution of the residuals is normal, then the probability of detecting 3 valid outliers or more would be 0.9956, (outliers: -2.7208,-3.5526,3.026).

Calculation

Step-by-step solution

Ŷ = b0 +b1X

b1 =	SPxy	=	Σ(xi-x̄)(yi-ȳ)

SSx	Σ(xi-x̄)2

b1 =	660.05	= 0.08318

7935.3

b0 = ȳ - b1x̄

x̄ = 81.65

ȳ = 3.6917

b0 = 3.6917-0.08318*81.65 = -3.0999

R2 =	SSRegression	=	Σ( ŷi - ȳ)2	=	54.9023	= 0.3771

SStotal	Σ( yi - ȳ)2	145.5917

The standard deviation of the residuals is:
MSresidual = S2res =	Σ( yi - ŷ)2n - 2

Residual outliers

Sres = √MSE = √0.7686 = 0.8767.

The average of the residuals is always zero.

The thresholds used to calculate the outliers are: ±k*Sres.

In this case, the thresholds are ±3*0.8767 = ±2.63.

We tagged the outliers with an arrow (⇐) at the 'Residual' column.

INSIGHT

Strategic Insights for Elite Global Internship Management Team

Based on the linear regression analysis between Assessment Score (X) and Satisfaction Rating (Y), here are actionable insights and recommendations for enhancing strategic planning:

1. Utilize Assessment Scores as a Predictor of Satisfaction

Key Insight: 

A higher assessment score is positively associated with increased satisfaction ratings (𝑅=
0.6141, 𝑏1=0.08318 R=0.6141,b 1​ =0.08318).

Implication: Assessment performance directly influences interns' satisfaction levels. High-performing interns are more likely to be satisfied with their experience.

Action Plan:
Design tailored intervention programs for interns with low assessment scores to boost their satisfaction. Examples include additional training sessions or mentorship opportunities.

Use assessment scores as a key metric for evaluating program quality and predicting satisfaction trends.

2. Focus on Program Improvements to Address Unexplained Variability

Key Insight: With 𝑅2 =37.7% R  2 =37.7%, the model explains a moderate portion of satisfaction variability. This leaves 62.3% of satisfaction influenced by other factors.

Implication: While assessment scores are important, satisfaction also depends on factors like program structure, mentor quality, workload, or career advancement opportunities.

Action Plan:
Conduct qualitative surveys or focus groups to identify additional factors impacting satisfaction.
Integrate these factors into an updated regression model to improve predictive power and design well-rounded strategies.

3. Leverage the X-Intercept (Threshold Analysis)

Key Insight: The x-intercept at 37.27

37.27 indicates that satisfaction ratings reach zero when assessment scores drop below this threshold.

Implication: Assessment scores below 37 could signal a critical dissatisfaction risk.

Action Plan:
Set a performance alert system to flag interns scoring near or below this threshold for immediate attention.
Provide remedial resources or feedback mechanisms to help interns improve their scores and satisfaction.

4. Address Outliers to Improve Strategic Decisions

Key Insight: Outliers in satisfaction ratings (e.g., −2.7208, −3.5526, 3.026 −2.7208,−3.5526,3.026) may distort overall trends.

Implication: These outliers could represent atypical cases, such as exceptional dissatisfaction or enthusiasm. Ignoring them may lead to incomplete insights.

Action Plan:
Investigate these cases individually to determine root causes (e.g., unresolved complaints, exceptional mentorship experiences).
Use insights to adjust the program for diverse intern experiences.

5. Focus on High-Impact Metrics for Program Quality

Key Insight: A significant F-statistic and slope (𝑝<0.05 p<0.05) confirm that assessment scores are a valuable predictor of satisfaction.

Implication: Investing in tools and processes to improve assessment performance will directly enhance satisfaction outcomes.

Action Plan:

Align teaching methods, curriculum design, and intern evaluation processes to focus on skill-building that maximizes assessment scores.
Incorporate periodic feedback loops where interns can voice concerns about their assessment process or training.

6. Strategic Forecasting

Key Insight: A predictive model allows simulation of satisfaction outcomes based on hypothetical changes in assessment scores.

Action Plan:
Use the regression equation 𝑌 = − 3.0999 + 0.08318 𝑋Y=−3.0999+0.08318X to project satisfaction for various average assessment scores.
Set realistic satisfaction targets (e.g., increasing average satisfaction by 5%) and back-calculate the required assessment score improvements.

7. Regular Monitoring and Reporting

Key Insight: Continuous tracking of satisfaction trends is essential for maintaining program relevance.

Action Plan:
Develop a dashboard for real-time tracking of assessment scores and satisfaction ratings.
Conduct quarterly analyses to assess whether strategic interventions are achieving desired outcomes.

Conclusion
By leveraging this predictive model, Elite Global Internship can systematically enhance intern satisfaction, improve program quality, and strengthen their reputation. Focused investments in training, tailored support for struggling interns, and addressing systemic issues will ensure both performance and satisfaction remain high, aligning with long-term strategic goals.
